This is a small addon mod for Calamity Mod created by everquartz with the help of a few people.
It aims to include the Starborn Princess (Deimos) as an NPC and items relating to her and stuff like that. It's not too big of a mod, but it does include what people have been wanting for a little while now. 
Big thanks to JesterRomut and gat for coding this. All sprites and concepts are practically done by everquartz alone.

This mod includes:
One new NPC.
2 new critters.
1 new pet.
4 new weapons.
3 new items
3 new placeables
2 new buffs
A transmogrification system.
(will change lmao)

A lot of stuff is from the Starborn Princess's fandom page already, however there are a couple of items, unique features and other things that aren't on the wiki page. 

This mod also supports the languages:
English
Russian
Chinese
