This is a small addon mod for Calamity Mod created by everquartz with the help of a few people.
It aims to include the Starborn Princess (Deimos) as an NPC and items relating to her and stuff like that. It's not too big of a mod, but it does include what people have been wanting for a little while now. 
Big thanks to JesterRomut and gat for coding this. All sprites and concepts are practically done by everquartz alone.

FORGOT TO MENTION: this mod is VERY buggy. It's not the absolute best quality but it can work fine. There may be future updates that fix these bugs, but if you think a bug is an issue and you'd like to report it, join the discord server and specifically click that you came here for the mod. There is a category for the mod and bug reports.

This mod includes:
One new NPC. (there is one and will be only one)
2 new critters.
1 new pet.
